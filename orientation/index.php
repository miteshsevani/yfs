				<p>The interview, orientation and mentoring process is a key part of the YFS journey. We create a space and platform to nurture each intern through personal challenges whilst facilitating group learning opportunities  along the way.</p>
				<p>Interns have an individual mentor dedicated to their growth throughout their journey.</p>
				<p>The 6-week internship is just the start of the journey! Upon their return, we encourage interns to engage in community projects to continue developing their skills and contribute to the world around them.</p>
