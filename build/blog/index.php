				<h3>YFS â€“ Why & Initial Thoughts</h3>
				<strong>Posted on August 3, 2016</strong>
				<p>Sewa in its simplest form is Selfless Service and to me it is greater than charity work through the relationships / personal touch made with those that you are serving. Due to my background as a Swayamsevak, the act of Sewa is promoted and is of great focus within our work, and any opportunity, no matter how small or large, should be taken if you are able to.</p>

				<h3>Longings, Development and Thoughts</h3>
				<strong>Posted on July 17, 2016</strong>
				<p>Three weeks from now I will be making my second trip to India as part of the YFS initiative. YFS (Youth for Sewa) is an internship program which takes on those of age 18-25. Then sends them to work on various sewa projects around India. The one I will be working on, is in the outskirts of Mumbai working for a charity which seeks to stop young children, who run away from home, being exploited by dangerous people. This blog essentially highlights my reasons for embarking on YFS and my general thoughts before going.</p>
